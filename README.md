## Theatre of Hades

This repo contains the in progress draft of my surrealist dialogue, The Theatre of Hades. It concerns the subject I call the Revolt of Reality, a rebellion of reality itself to false structures and systems placed upon it. Particular interest is paid to the false realities the characters place on their own lives, but all structures, even the "laws of nature" are subject to flux in this story.

The folder toh.markdown contains the raw markdown files that represent the chapters. (For more about markdown, check [here](https://www.markdown.com).) You may find a markdown converter or editor helpful, but the chapters should be readable by themselves, provided of course, you have a table of contents. Of great fun in this work were my unusual chapter titles. This list is still subject to change.

### Regarding Collobaration, Issues, and Pull Requests

This work of fiction was conceived of as I project to be solely written by me. My initial intention in placing it on github was to have a backup copy. I have no intention of pulling in additional chapters to those listed in the Table of Contents.

If you want to help the project along, the best thing you could do would be to open issues in which you offer constructive criticism either of the work as a whole or individual chapters. Having eyes on your writing is just as helpful as having eyes on your code.

I will have to get a hold of / write the scripts that will turn the story from a directory of markdown stories into one readable document. Publishing the work as an e-book or traditional book may follow, particularly if I can get people excited about the project.

### Essays / Supplemental Materials

This repo needs some tidying. I have plans to place supplementary materials, such as essays on my personal approach to writing, and some biographical materials. You can likely find them if explore the repo and checkout the project in earlier stages.
